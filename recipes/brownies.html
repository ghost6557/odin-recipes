    <h2>How To Make Mexican Brownies</h2>
    <p>What makes these Mexican brownies different, you ask? It's the unique hit of cayenne and cinnamon in every fudgy bite.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray, nonstick, or oil, for greasing pan</li>
        <li>1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1⁄3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1⁄2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1⁄2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1⁄4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1⁄2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1⁄4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large egg</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the inside of an 8-inch square baking pan with nonstick spray or oil. Line the pan with parchment paper, and then spray the parchment with nonstick spray or oil as well.</li>
        <li>Add flour, cocoa powder, salt, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper to a large bowl. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add butter and chocolate chips. Stir continuously until the mixture has completely melted.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and egg yolk. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture. Fold together with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Try not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter in the prepared baking pan and bake for 32 to 36 minutes, until the center is firm and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean.</li>
        <li>Let the brownies cool completely in the pan, then transfer to a cutting board slice into squares.</li>
    </ol>
